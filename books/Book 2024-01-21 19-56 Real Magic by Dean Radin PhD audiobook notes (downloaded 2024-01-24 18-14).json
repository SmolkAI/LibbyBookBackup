So I have to remember that, when reading this book, I need to have bittul; I need to have an open mind"

We shouldn't practice it, probably for fear of exactly what they're saying here, that people might turn away and it's easier to control people if they only believe what you want them to, but there's nothing inherently against magic. Kabbalah is essentially magic. The belief his neck, given the proper incantation and using the right words, you can essentially create anything. That's why names have such power. And God created the world in six days through speech"

I.E. it\u2019s more likely to happen and be reported by people who are more likely to believe in something that isn\u2019t real, at a time when they are at a heightened state of sensitivity to this unreal sphere. Of course, this can be said another way, that people are \u201cmore likely to experience this magical realm when they're at a heightened state of sensitivity\u201d; if you\u2019re of the sort inclined to believe this is true, this is how you\u2019d say it and it means roughly the same thing that I said above]"
